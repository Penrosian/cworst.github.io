Symmetric encryption is a way to encrypt your messages using a key, but it used
the same key to decrypt the massage. Asymmetric key encription is a way to encry
pt messages, but with two seperate keys which is more secure than the symmetric encryption method

The encryption process starts with creating a folder with two other folders also
 inside, one that says send and the other that says recieve. Then, using specific commands it will prompt you to write your message and send it to who you want to. After you send it you have to commit the encrypted message to your repo for the recipient. To decrypt the senders message, you have to get the encrypted message from your repo that you would copy and paste after adding a decryption scrypt to terminal. After, your secret message would show up and you would be able to read it. 
  
It is important you never share your privte key because any really secret message you try and send will never be fully safe for you to share
