<ul>
<li>
	<a href="recipe1.html">Jello</a>
</li>
<li>Jello is my moms 'signature' recipe and is what she always brings to family gatherings. My favorite flavor is blue raspberry but, red is always on sale so we like never get it. :(</li>
<li>
	<a href="recipe2.html">Cookie</a>
</li>
<li>Everyone loves cookies and its very simple so I had to write about it here. I used my moms recipe, but she says she got it from a website a while ago. Im actually pretty sure I found the website my mom found the cookie recipe on, it says it was made in like 2015 so im assuming this is it.
