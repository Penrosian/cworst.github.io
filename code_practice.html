<h1>Welcome To My Youtube Video!!!</h1>
<h2>This is a lesson about creating a website using HTML</h2>
<pre>look at this cool font</pre>
<br> 
<h3>How to create the html website</h3>
<p>This is just the basics
<br>
<code>
First you would do "vim [name].html" This is in your website folder.
<br>
After that you should be brought to a vim page and you would first type &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; (This is just to differentiate which coding language you are going to use)
<br>
Then you would use &lt;html lang="[language]"&gt;
<br>
The website is split into two parts, the head and body. You would section them like &lt;head&gt;, &lt;/head&gt; and &lt;body&gt;, &lt;/body&gt;
<br>
In the head section you could use &lt;Title&gt;websitename&lt;/title&gt; to make your website address.
</code>
</p>

<p>
<h3>The elements inside!</h3> 
After you set out the foundation of your html page (head and body), you would add text using any of these. Make sure to use the less than or equal to signs too!
<ol>

<li> p (for paragraphs)</li>
<li> br (this is how to make text seperate from another line)</li>
<li> ol (this is to start an ordered list)</li>
<li> ul (this is for unordered lists)
<li> li (these are all the elements of the lisst, the list items. These are used in ul and ol.)</li>

</ol>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Stuff to make your text looks cool</h3>

<ul>
<li> kbd (this will make a <kbd>cool font</kbd> for your words) </li>
<li> samp (this makes your font look <samp>special</samp> to draw attention) </li>
<li> pre (similarly you can use this for a cool look that is the same as samp but it can be sued to show less than or equal to signs for example of codes!)</li>
<li> em (this lets you make font <em>italics</em>)</li>
<li> strong (this makes your text <strong>bold</strong>)</li>
<li> mark (this makes your text <mark>highlighted</mark>)</li>
</body>
