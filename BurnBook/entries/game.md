#What genre is your game
 - My game is a whack-a-mole type game where waves bring seashells and trash to the shore and you have to pick them up by pressing them.

#What are the objectives? Will there be a score? How do you win or lose?
 - The objective is trying to pick up as much trash/shells as you can before the time runs out. Waves will come to reset the shells and trash after 5 seconds. If you successfully last 1 minute in the game then you win. If you get caught by the wave or fail to pick up a peice of trash then you lose. Shells will be optional to pick up for extra points but you HAVE to pick up the trash. There are two types of buckets, one for specifically trash and one for only seashells. There is no penalty for trying to pick up the items with the wrong bucket, but they wont get picked up without the right bucket.

#How will the player interact with the game?
 - The player will move using the arrow keys to move the bucket.

#What features will you include in your MVP?
 - The MVP will use the same mechanics but it wont have the different bucket rule or a score.
