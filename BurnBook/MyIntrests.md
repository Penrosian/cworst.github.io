* What can I say? Third grade obsessions last.

## Homework for 9/13
* I think the importance of the terminal is that it is a great way to make websites and learn more about your computer and how it really works behind the scenes. Git is important for retracing your steps and making sure that you know what you are doing. Vim is an easy way to edit parts of your website, like what im doing now! Lastly, markdown is a good way to format your websites like with bulletpoints and headers. 

* I feel a bit overwhelmed by the amount of stuff we are learning from the terminal, but I do like the creativity it allows us!

* This is a very complicated process, and I definitely gave up a couple times, but I think this is a valuable skill and with the rigth dedication and work, you can do it!
